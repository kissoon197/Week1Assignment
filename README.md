# Week1Assignment

The assignment for week 1
What I did achieve:
I have a Header, Nav, and Footer, and more. I believe that i used these tags correctly.

I utilised some elements of the CSS flexbox in my navbar, but I was unable to utilise it to complete the navbar to my liking.
All image elements are correctly implemented with accurate file paths.

I created a "Back to top" button at the bottom of the page, to go back to the Navbar at the top of the page.
I ended up managing to fix the hover for the contact us button at the bottom to highlight it with a lovely tomato colour. Very thematic!

Requirements and goals that I was unable to achieve:
I made an attempt to change the hyperlinks. I wanted them to look less like hyperlinks, but gave up and reverted it back.
I changed the a tags to p tags on these elements to make a start, but it broke my entire functionality of the website, and I was unsure on why.

I also wanted to remove the white spaces I have in between some areas, I couldn't figure out how to without using the \* tag in styles, which made the whole web page more densely packed instead of just the gaps I had in the background.

I was unable to utilize CSS absolute positioning properly, so I gave up.
