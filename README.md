# Week1Assignment

The assignment for week 1
I have a Header, Nav, and Footer.
All image elements are correctly implemented with accurate file paths.

I made an attempt to change the hyperlinks. I wanted them to look less like hyperlinks, but gave up and reverted it back.
I changed the a tags to p tags on these elements to make a start, but it broke my entire functionality of the website, and I was unsure on why.

I also wanted to remove the white spaces I have in between some areas, I couldn't figure out how to without using the \* tag in styles, which made the whole web page more densely packed instead of just the gaps I had in the background.
